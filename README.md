I like array programming and recreational programming. Normally I program in Ruby and APL.

I like making learning materials and documentation ([K Wiki](https://k.miraheze.org), Factor, BQN, etc).

I also post on [my blog](https://razetime.github.io/blog).

Contact me at any of the links [here](http://razetime.github.io/contact).
