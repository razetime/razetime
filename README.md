I'm Raghu.

I like array programming and recreational programming (especially code golf). Normally I program in Ruby and APL. Currently I am learning about compilers and interpreters.

I like writing learning materials and documentation. You can see my work on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPrZs9ZK3dqMad_cMELK24Q), [BQN REPL help pages](https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/help/index.html), and [The Esolangery](https://esolangery.quora.com/).

If you'd like some help on your project, feel free to contact me at any of the links [here](http://razetime.github.io/contact).

I currently maintain:
- [The K Language wiki](https://k.miraheze.org/wiki/Main_Page)
- [Nial Language website](https://nial-array-language.org/)
- [APL Golfing UI](https://razetime.github.io/APLgolf/), [Golfing language list](https://github.com/razetime/code-golf/blob/master/golflang-list.md)

In progress (may not be up to date):
- [ngn/k tutorial](https://github.com/razetime/ngn-k-tutorial)
- [Zirconium Interpreter](https://github.com/razetime/Zirconium)
