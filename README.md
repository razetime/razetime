I like array programming and recreational programming (especially code golf). Normally I program in Ruby and APL. Currently I'm doing a project on TruffleRuby for Google Summer of Code.

I like making learning materials and documentation (one example is the [K Wiki](https://k.miraheze.org)).

I also post some stuff on:
